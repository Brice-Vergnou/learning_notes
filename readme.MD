# :wave: Hello

Welcome to my data science diary, where I keep track of my findings when learning stuff

There will be notes, as well as some random code snippets or assignements (or even more ?). It's not meant to be a project, rather a place where I can save my notes and let them publicly accessible to anyone

Enjoy <3

List of the courses so far :
* Coursera
  * [Machine Learning Specialization](https://github.com/Brice-Vergnou/learning_notes/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20Specialization)
