# :wave: Hello

Welcome to my data science diary, where I keep track of my findings when learning stuff

There will be notes, as well as some random code snippets or assignements (or even more ?). It's not meant to be a project, rather a place where I can save my notes and let them publicly accessible to anyone. 

Enjoy <3
