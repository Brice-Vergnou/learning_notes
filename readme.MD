# :wave: Hello

Welcome to my data science diary, where I keep track of my findings when learning stuff

There will be notes, as well as some random code snippets or assignements (or even more ?). It's not meant to be a project, rather a place where I can save my notes and let them publicly accessible to anyone. I may use these notes for myself to write articles so it's why I may sometimes comment the way the content is being taught.

Enjoy <3

List of the courses so far :
* linuxjourney
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)
  * Linear Algebra

### Logs :
(it allows me to keep track to my progress by creating a streak to "gamify" my learning)

* Mar 21, 2022 : unenrolled from the "Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach" course as it felt too basic and I didn't feel like I was progressing. Started the "Mathematics for Machin Learning" Path.
* Mar 22, 2022 : worked on dot product and some other stuff, it's great because it's revisiting a concept i've been taught for years
* Mar 23, 2022: Wrote an entire article reviewing [the first course I watched](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/), and submitted the draft to a few publications
* Mar 24, 2022: Started a Kaggle competition, HappyWhale. It'll be a great occasion to learn about Yolo and a ton of other stuff :)
* Mar 25, 2022: Watched an introduction to YOLO to prepare for the competition, and continued the linear algebra course.
* Mar 28, 2022: Studied different algorithm to tackle the competition
* Mar 29, 2022: Continued Linear algebra course
* Mar 30, 2022: Continued linear algebra course, linux101 project
* Mar 31, 2022: Continued linux101 project, happywhale project and started reviewing the ZTM TF course
* Apr 1, 2022: Started a Robot Soccer project for highschool
* Apr 2, 2022: First notebook for the HappyWhale competition
