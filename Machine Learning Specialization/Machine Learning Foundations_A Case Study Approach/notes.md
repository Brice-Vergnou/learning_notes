## Week 1

Introduce to the tools we're going to use, like Jupyter, Python ( I already knew those ), but also SFrames, which is a Pandas alternative which allows to dump a dataset progressively, so you can go through it even if your dataset is larger than your RAM capacity.

It's just a shame the videos about SFrames are not updated, as the notebook provided uses slight different syntaxes as the module was updated.

The syntax is somewhat similar to Pandas, for the moment I don't feel the difference as i didn't test it on large datasets

## Week 2

They start by talking about regression as if we would do it by hand, so we can understand the theory first before getting our hands dirty. Even though I personally knew about this concept, the images that were given help to better remember it.
