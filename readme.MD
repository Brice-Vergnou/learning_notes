# :wave: Hello

Welcome to my data science diary, where I keep track of my findings when learning stuff

There will be notes, as well as some random code snippets or assignements (or even more ?). It's not meant to be a project, rather a place where I can save my notes and let them publicly accessible to anyone. I may use these notes for myself to write articles so it's why I may sometimes comment the way the content is being taught.

Enjoy <3

List of the courses so far :
* linuxjourney
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)
  * Linear Algebra

### Logs :
(it allows me to keep track to my progress by creating a streak to "gamify" my learning)

* Mar 21, 2022 : unenrolled from the "Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach" course as it felt too basic and I didn't feel like I was progressing. Started the "Mathematics for Machin Learning" Path.
* Mar 22, 2022 : worked on dot product and some other stuff, it's great because it's revisiting a concept i've been taught for years
